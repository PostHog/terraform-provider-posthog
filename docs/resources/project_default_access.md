# posthog_project_default_access (Resource)

Sets the default access level for a PostHog project.

This determines the baseline access level for all organization members who don't have explicit access granted via roles or direct membership.

~> **Note:** There is only one default access level per project. This resource is a singleton - creating multiple instances for the same project will cause conflicts.

~> **Destroy Behavior:** Destroying this resource resets the default access level to `none` (most restrictive). It does not restore the previous value.

~> **Enterprise Feature:** Role-based access control (RBAC) requires a PostHog Enterprise plan. See [Access Control documentation](https://posthog.com/docs/settings/access-control) for more details.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Set the default access level for a project
# Everyone without explicit access will have this level
resource "posthog_project_default_access" "restrictive" {
  project_id   = "your-project-id"
  access_level = "none" # Options: none, member, admin
}

# Use with provider-level project_id
resource "posthog_project_default_access" "default" {
  access_level = "member"
}
```

# posthog_access_control (Resource)

Manages access control for resources within a PostHog project.

This resource allows you to set access levels for resource types (like feature flags, dashboards, etc.).

You can set permissions at three levels:
- **Project default**: Applies to everyone in the project for this resource type. Omit both `role` and `organization_member`.
- **Role-specific**: Applies to members of a specific role. Set `role`.
- **Member-specific**: Applies to a specific organization member. Set `organization_member`.

Additionally, you can scope to:
- **Resource-type level**: Applies to all resources of a type (e.g., all dashboards). Omit `resource_id`.
- **Resource-instance level**: Applies to a specific resource (e.g., one dashboard). Set `resource_id`.

You can combine these: set a project default for all dashboards, or set a project default for a specific dashboard.

~> **Note:** `role` and `organization_member` are mutually exclusive - you cannot specify both. Omit both for project defaults.

~> **Enterprise Feature:** Role-based access control (RBAC) requires a PostHog Enterprise plan. See [Access Control documentation](https://posthog.com/docs/settings/access-control) for more details.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# --- Project Defaults (no role or organization_member) ---

# Set project-wide default: everyone can view surveys
resource "posthog_access_control" "surveys_project_default" {
  resource     = "survey"
  access_level = "viewer"
}

# Set default for a specific dashboard: everyone can view this dashboard
resource "posthog_access_control" "analytics_dashboard_default" {
  resource     = "dashboard"
  resource_id  = posthog_dashboard.analytics.id
  access_level = "viewer"
}

# --- Role-based Access ---

# Grant a role editor access to all feature flags in the project
resource "posthog_access_control" "engineering_feature_flags" {
  resource     = "feature_flag"
  access_level = "editor"
  role         = posthog_role.engineering.id
}

# Grant a role viewer access to all dashboards
resource "posthog_access_control" "support_dashboards" {
  resource     = "dashboard"
  access_level = "viewer"
  role         = posthog_role.support.id
}

# Grant a role viewer access to a specific dashboard
resource "posthog_access_control" "support_analytics_dashboard" {
  resource     = "dashboard"
  resource_id  = posthog_dashboard.analytics.id
  access_level = "viewer"
  role         = posthog_role.support.id
}

# Explicitly deny a role access to experiments (access_level = "none")
resource "posthog_access_control" "support_no_experiments" {
  resource     = "experiment"
  access_level = "none"
  role         = posthog_role.support.id
}

# --- User-specific Access ---

# Grant a specific user editor access to a specific dashboard
resource "posthog_access_control" "alice_analytics_dashboard" {
  resource            = "dashboard"
  resource_id         = posthog_dashboard.analytics.id
  access_level        = "editor"
  organization_member = posthog_organization_member.alice.id
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `access_level` (String) The access level to grant. Common values are `none`, `viewer`, `editor`.
- `resource` (String) The resource type to control access for. Valid values include: `action`, `alert`, `annotation`, `cohort`, `dashboard`, `experiment`, `feature_flag`, `insight`, `notebook`, `session_recording`, `survey`, etc.

### Optional

- `organization_member` (String) The organization member ID to grant access to (either `organization_member_id` from `posthog_user` data source, or `posthog_organization_member.<name>.id`). Mutually exclusive with `role`. If neither `role` nor `organization_member` is set, this becomes the project default for the resource type.
- `project_id` (String) Project ID (environment) for this resource. Overrides the provider-level project_id.
- `resource_id` (String) The ID of a specific resource to control access for. If omitted, the access control applies to all resources of the specified type.
- `role` (String) The UUID of the role to grant access to. Mutually exclusive with `organization_member`. If neither `role` nor `organization_member` is set, this becomes the project default for the resource type.

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) Timestamp when the access control was created.
- `id` (String) Composite identifier for the access control.
- `updated_at` (String) Timestamp when the access control was last updated.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# Import format for project default (all resources of a type):
# project_id/resource_type/default
terraform import posthog_access_control.surveys_project_default 12345/survey/default

# Import format for project default on a specific resource:
# project_id/resource_type/resource_id/default
terraform import posthog_access_control.analytics_dashboard_default 12345/dashboard/999/default

# Import format for role-based access control (resource type level):
# project_id/resource_type/role/role_id
terraform import posthog_access_control.engineering_feature_flags 12345/feature_flag/role/abc-123-def

# Import format for member-based access control (resource type level):
# project_id/resource_type/member/member_id
terraform import posthog_access_control.alice_dashboards 12345/dashboard/member/xyz-456-uvw

# Import format for role-based access control (specific resource):
# project_id/resource_type/resource_id/role/role_id
terraform import posthog_access_control.role_specific_dashboard 12345/dashboard/999/role/abc-123-def

# Import format for member-based access control (specific resource):
# project_id/resource_type/resource_id/member/member_id
terraform import posthog_access_control.alice_specific_dashboard 12345/dashboard/999/member/xyz-456-uvw
```

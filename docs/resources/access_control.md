# posthog_access_control (Resource)

Manages access control for resources within a PostHog project.

This resource allows you to grant roles or specific organization members access to resource types (like feature flags, dashboards, etc.) at different access levels.

You can set permissions at two levels:
- **Resource-type level**: Applies to all resources of a type (e.g., all dashboards). Omit `resource_id`.
- **Resource-instance level**: Applies to a specific resource (e.g., one dashboard). Set `resource_id`.

~> **Note:** You must specify either `role` or `organization_member`, but not both.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Grant a role editor access to all feature flags in the project
resource "posthog_access_control" "engineering_feature_flags" {
  resource     = "feature_flag"
  access_level = "editor"
  role         = posthog_role.engineering.id
}

# Grant a role viewer access to all dashboards
resource "posthog_access_control" "support_dashboards" {
  resource     = "dashboard"
  access_level = "viewer"
  role         = posthog_role.support.id
}

# Grant a role viewer access to a specific dashboard
resource "posthog_access_control" "support_analytics_dashboard" {
  resource     = "dashboard"
  resource_id  = posthog_dashboard.analytics.id
  access_level = "viewer"
  role         = posthog_role.support.id
}

# Grant a specific user editor access to a specific dashboard
resource "posthog_access_control" "alice_analytics_dashboard" {
  resource            = "dashboard"
  resource_id         = posthog_dashboard.analytics.id
  access_level        = "editor"
  organization_member = posthog_organization_member.alice.id
}

# Explicitly deny a role access to experiments (access_level = "none")
resource "posthog_access_control" "support_no_experiments" {
  resource     = "experiment"
  access_level = "none"
  role         = posthog_role.support.id
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `access_level` (String) The access level to grant. Common values are `none`, `viewer`, `editor`, `admin`
- `resource` (String) The resource type to control access for. Valid values include: `action`, `alert`, `annotation`, `cohort`, `dashboard`, `experiment`, `feature_flag`, `insight`, `notebook`, `session_recording`, etc.

### Optional

- `organization_member` (String) The UUID of the organization member to grant access to. Mutually exclusive with `role`.
- `project_id` (String) Project ID (environment) for this resource. Overrides the provider-level project_id.
- `resource_id` (String) The ID of a specific resource to control access for. If omitted, the access control applies to all resources of the specified type.
- `role` (String) The UUID of the role to grant access to. Mutually exclusive with `organization_member`.

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) Timestamp when the access control was created.
- `id` (String) Composite identifier for the access control.
- `updated_at` (String) Timestamp when the access control was last updated.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# Import format for resource-type level access control:
# project_id/resource_type/role/role_id
terraform import posthog_access_control.engineering_feature_flags 12345/feature_flag/role/abc-123-def

# Import format for resource-type level access control with organization member:
# project_id/resource_type/member/member_id
terraform import posthog_access_control.alice_dashboards 12345/dashboard/member/xyz-456-uvw

# Import format for resource-instance level access control:
# project_id/resource_type/resource_id/role/role_id
terraform import posthog_access_control.role_specific_dashboard 12345/dashboard/999/role/abc-123-def

# Import format for resource-instance level access control with organization member:
# project_id/resource_type/resource_id/member/member_id
terraform import posthog_access_control.alice_specific_dashboard 12345/dashboard/999/member/xyz-456-uvw
```

        \ $ai_embedding, or $ai_trace)\ninto formatted text representations suitable\
        \ for display, logging, or analysis.\n\n**Supported Event Types:**\n- `$ai_generation`:\
        \ Individual LLM API calls with input/output messages\n- `$ai_span`: Logical\
        \ spans with state transitions\n- `$ai_embedding`: Embedding generation events\
        \ (text input → vector)\n- `$ai_trace`: Full traces with hierarchical structure\n\
        \n**Options:**\n- `max_length`: Maximum character count (default: 4000000)\n\
        - `truncated`: Enable middle-content truncation within events (default: true)\n\
        - `truncate_buffer`: Characters at start/end when truncating (default: 1000)\n\
        - `include_markers`: Use interactive markers vs plain text indicators (default:\
        \ true)\n  - Frontend: set true for `<<<TRUNCATED|base64|...>>>` markers\n\
        \  - Backend/LLM: set false for `... (X chars truncated) ...` text\n- `collapsed`:\
        \ Show summary vs full trace tree (default: false)\n- `include_hierarchy`:\
        \ Include tree structure for traces (default: true)\n- `max_depth`: Maximum\
        \ depth for hierarchical rendering (default: unlimited)\n- `tools_collapse_threshold`:\
        \ Number of tools before auto-collapsing list (default: 5)\n  - Tool lists\
        \ >5 items show `<<<TOOLS_EXPANDABLE|...>>>` marker for frontend\n  - Or `[+]\
        \ AVAILABLE TOOLS: N` for backend when `include_markers: false`\n- `include_line_numbers`:\
        \ Prefix each line with line number like L001:, L010: (default: false)\n\n\
        **Use Cases:**\n- Frontend display: `truncated: true, include_markers: true,\
        \ include_line_numbers: true`\n- Backend LLM context (summary): `truncated:\
        \ true, include_markers: false, collapsed: true`\n- Backend LLM context (full):\
        \ `truncated: false`\n\nThe response includes the formatted text and metadata\

        Like `ProjectBasicSerializer`, but also works as a drop-in replacement for `TeamBasicSerializer` by way of
        passthrough fields. This allows the meaning of `Team` to change from "project" to "environment" without breaking
        backward compatibility of the REST API.
        Do not use this in greenfield endpoints!

        Like `ProjectBasicSerializer`, but also works as a drop-in replacement for `TeamBasicSerializer` by way of
        passthrough fields. This allows the meaning of `Team` to change from "project" to "environment" without breaking
        backward compatibility of the REST API.

    ProjectBackwardCompatBasic:

        Like `ProjectBasicSerializer`, but also works as a drop-in replacement for `TeamBasicSerializer` by way of
        passthrough fields. This allows the meaning of `Team` to change from "project" to "environment" without breaking
        backward compatibility of the REST API.
        Do not use this in greenfield endpoints!

             You can use a simplified version:
            ```json
            {
                "properties": [
                    {
                        "key": "email",
                        "value": "x@y.com",
                        "operator": "exact",
                        "type": "event"
                    }
                ]
            }
            ```

            Or you can create more complicated queries with AND and OR:
            ```json
            {
                "properties": {
                    "type": "AND",

                        {
                            "type": "OR",
                            "values": [
                                {"key": "email", ...},
                                {"key": "email", ...}
                            ]
                        },
                        {
                            "type": "AND",
                            "values": [
                                {"key": "email", ...},
                                {"key": "email", ...}

                    ]
                ]
            }
